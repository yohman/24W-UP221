# Clone your repo

Go to your class repo page. The URL should look something like this: 

`https://github.com/your_name/up221`

Copy the clone URL:

Launch JupyterHub

Make sure you are at the root folder: 

<kbd><img src="images/root.png"></kbd>

You can change the directory using the cd command 

In the file menu bar, go to `Git`, `Clone a Repository`:

<kbd><img src="images/gitclone.png"></kbd>

If this does not work, it is helpful to use the terminal to manually clone and push using terminal:

With terminal open, type in ```pwd``` to check your working directory. To nest to upwards, you type ```.../``` for each folder you want to get out of. [More information on changing directories](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/command-line-101). To change directories to your GitHub up221- repo, type ```cd``` and the name of your folder. First, we will ```git clone https://github.com/username/up221-yourname.git```. This will pull in your remote repository. You can add folders and ipython notebooks and push them to your GitHub throughout the Quarter.

Enter (paste) the URL to your repo

You should now see your repo in the root directory:

<kbd><img src="images/up221.png"></kbd>

From here onwards, this will be your workspace for individual assignments, code experiments, and general data science work related to the class.
