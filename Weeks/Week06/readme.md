## Assignments

### Individual assignment: Provide feedback to one (or more) midterm projects

Go to the discussion section and navigate to the [midterm assignments](https://github.com/cgiamarino9/24W-UP221/discussions/8). Provide feedback to **one other midterm projects**, making sure to include the following:

- What you liked about the project. Be specific!
- What you recommend the project can work on/improve on for the final (data suggestions (with links), code advice (usage of functions, loops, etc), features, additional layers, design/interactive components, improved layout, narrative flow, etc)

Do not provide feedback to a project that already has too many comments!
