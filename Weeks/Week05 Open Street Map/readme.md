- Presentations
  -  10 minutes per group
  -  Each group member must present a portion of the project, for roughly an equal time of the presentation
  -  You can use any form of visual aids, including powerpoints, google slides, spreadsheets, and/or JupyterNotebooks
  -  Prepare and rehearse
  -  Most importantly, tell a story, and convey why this is an important issue that warrants our attention

## Presentation guidelines
- Tips for a good presentation:
  - Images are worth 1000 words (i.e. minimal use of bullet points)
  - Let your visuals narrate the story you tell, not text or bullet points
  - Talk to the audience, not your computer or the screen
  - Show your passion!
